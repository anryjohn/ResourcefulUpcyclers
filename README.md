Make businesses more efficient and effective with the help of novel supply chain operations. 
A piece of software that empowers a business to act as a depot for office supplies.

This system helps to categorize these goods and make their storage locatable. 
Manages incoming requests, attempting to match requestors with the needed goods once sufficient supplies were stocked. 
This office supply store redistributes these donated items to no profit businesses in the area at a fraction of the retail price.
